# dns-server

Initially created as part of the Code Crafters DNS Challenge. But since
completing it I have started implementing more of the spec. Specific specs
implemented will be listed here:
- [RFC 1035: DOMAIN NAMES - IMPLEMENTATION AND SPECIFICATION](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035)
